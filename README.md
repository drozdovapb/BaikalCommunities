# BaikalCommunities
This is the github repository along our project  'Comparative analysis of free-living and microeukaryote-associated bacterial communities in the photic layer of Lake Baikal".

Lake Baikal is an oligotrophic water body with low concentration of nutrients. During the ice period, the upper layer of water near the bottom surface of the ice is increasingly enriched with nutrients due to salting out processes (doi:10.1080/03680770.1998.11898179) which promotes the development of microorganisms. The goal of the project is to identify similarities and differences in communities of bacteria and microeukaryotes living on the bottom surface of the ice and water column of Lake Baikal using metabarcoding of 16S and 18S rRNA gene fragments. In addition, we will try to determine the relationship of communities with physical and chemical environmental factors.
